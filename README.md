# ExAws IAM

### This is a fork of the library ExAws.IAM available at https://github.com/abitdodgy/ex_aws_iam with added PutUserPolicy function.

Easily interact with the AWS IAM API to work with users, access keys, and any other entity. This is an IAM service module for [ExAws](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws).

The lib provides a low-level `operation/3` function to build any IAM API action.

```elixir
op = IAM.operation(:list_users, max_items: 50, path: "/my/path/")
%ExAws.Operation.Query{
  action: "ListUsers",
  params: %{
    "Action" => "ListUsers",
    "MaxItems" => 50,
    "Path" => "/my/path/",
    "Version" => "2010-05-08"
  },
  parser: &ExAws.IAM.Parser.parse/2,
  path: "/my/path/",
  service: :iam
}

resp = ExAws.request(op)
{:ok,
 %{
   body: %{
     list_users_result: %{
       is_truncated: "false",
       users: [
         %{
           arn: "arn:aws:iam::085326204011:user/my/path/abitdodgy",
           create_date: "2018-10-17T00:09:19Z",
           path: "/my/path/",
           user_id: "AIDAIAPPW7ERTKFL2R3TI",
           user_name: "abitdodgy"
         }
       ]
     },
     response_metadata: %{request_id: "25c67fa6-d212-11e8-b8d6-a7951e68fc2c"}
   },
   status_code: 200
 }}
```

The lib also provides higher-level convenience functions for interacting with specific services.

```elixir
op = IAM.create_user("my_user", path: "/my/path")
%ExAws.Operation.Query{
  action: "CreateUser",
  params: %{
    "Action" => "CreateUser",
    "Path" => "/my/path",
    "UserName" => "my_user",
    "Version" => "2010-05-08"
  },
  parser: &ExAws.IAM.Parser.parse/2,
  path: "/my/path",
  service: :iam
}
```

You can also return entity structs.

```
user =
  op
  |> ExAws.request()
  |> IAM.to_user()

%IAM.User{
  arn: "arn:aws:iam::085326204011:user/my_user",
  create_date: "2018-10-17T13:36:28Z",
  path: "/my/path/",
  user_name: "my_user",
  user_id: "AIDAJMIUVQAU2TW666HH2"
}

IAM.delete_user("my_user")
```

Parsers are currently implemented for the following actions:

  * CreateAccessKey
  * CreateGroup
  * CreateUser
  * DeleteAccessKey
  * DeleteGroup
  * DeleteUser
  * GetAccessKeyLastUsed
  * GetGroup
  * GetUser
  * ListAccessKeys
  * ListGroup
  * ListRoles
  * ListRoleTags
  * ListUsers
  * PutUserPolicy
  * UpdateAccessKey
  * UpdateGroup
  * UpdateUser

You can also provider your own parser as long as it implements a `parse/2` function.

```elixir
IAM.operation(:list_users, parser: &MyParser.parse/2)
```

## Installation

Ensure that both `ex_aws`, its dependencies, and `ex_aws_iam` are in your list of dependencies.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.5"},
    {:ex_aws_iam, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Ensure that ExAws is properly configured.

```
config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, :instance_role]
```
